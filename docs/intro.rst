Hotcount Remastered
====================

Hotcount remastered is a simple software to count number of occurence of a regular expression
corresponding to a mutation in the genome.This software can be use when the mutation sequence is known.
It is very useful with mutation placed in highly repeted region.
The software allow to check if the mutation is superior to the noise. For this the software use
a Fischer test.

organisation
=============
there is 3 main option countwhich only count occurence of all the regular expression writen in the parameter file,
stat which only make statistic on a count file and all which make in one time the count and the statistic.

python_Bio_Regexp
==================
this software is base on the python_bio_regexp library a library i design previously.
This library allow to work with genomic regular expression, make the reverse complement of a regular expression, use IUPAC for regular expression
and several way of research of regular expression in sequence string
